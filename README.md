# Automating-Website-Performance-with-Security-Enhancements
Automation: Implemented security scans and automated resolvers to optimize website performance, significantly improving page load times and security threats. Enhanced input validation and sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) and more.

Vulnerability Scanner and Fixer
This project contains a Python script designed to scan PHP files in a directory for common web application vulnerabilities and automatically apply fixes. The script specifically targets vulnerabilities such as plaintext password storage, missing input sanitization, missing CSRF tokens, and various HTTP security headers.

Features
Scans PHP files: Identifies vulnerabilities in PHP code.
Automatically fixes issues: Replaces insecure code with secure implementations.
Adds security headers: Ensures proper HTTP headers are set for security.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
PHP: The script is intended for use with PHP files.
Usage
Clone or download this repository.

Place your PHP files: Ensure that the PHP files you want to scan are located in a directory (e.g., vul_web).

Run the script:

bash
python3 check_vulnerabilities.py <path_to_directory>

Replace <path_to_directory> with the path to the directory containing your PHP files,
